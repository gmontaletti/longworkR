\title{Calculate Career Quality Metrics Combining Quality and Stability}
\usage{
calculate_career_quality_metrics(
  data,
  survival_data = NULL,
  id_column = "cf",
  time_period_column = NULL,
  contract_code_column = "COD_TIPOLOGIA_CONTRATTUALE",
  employment_intensity_column = "prior",
  min_spell_duration = 7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.table containing employment records}

\item{survival_data}{Optional. Pre-computed survival analysis results. If NULL, will
compute basic duration measures.}

\item{id_column}{Character. Name of person identifier column. Default: "cf"}

\item{time_period_column}{Character. Optional column for grouping by time periods. Default: NULL}

\item{contract_code_column}{Character. Column containing contract type codes. Default: "COD_TIPOLOGIA_CONTRATTUALE"}

\item{employment_intensity_column}{Character. Column indicating employment intensity (prior). Default: "prior"}

\item{min_spell_duration}{Numeric. Minimum duration (days) to include in analysis. Default: 7}
}
\value{
A data.table with comprehensive career metrics:
\item{cf}{Person identifier}
\item{time_period}{Time period (if specified)}
\item{total_employment_days}{Total days in employment}
\item{contract_quality_score}{Duration-weighted average contract quality (0-1)}
\item{employment_intensity_score}{Duration-weighted average employment intensity (0-1)}
\item{career_stability_score}{Stability based on duration consistency (0-1)}
\item{growth_opportunity_score}{Access to diverse, high-quality contracts (0-1)}
\item{career_quality_index}{Unified career performance index (0-1)}
}
\description{
Computes a unified career performance index that combines quality, stability, and
opportunity measures from survival analysis. This single index replaces the separate
quality and risk metrics to provide a coherent 0-1 scale where higher values indicate
better career outcomes with balanced stability and growth potential.
}
\details{
The comprehensive career index combines multiple dimensions:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Contract Quality (35\%)}: Based on survival analysis median durations
\item \strong{Employment Intensity (25\%)}: Full-time vs part-time employment patterns
\item \strong{Career Stability (25\%)}: Contract duration consistency and low volatility
\item \strong{Growth Opportunity (15\%)}: Access to diverse, higher-quality contract types
}

Unlike separate quality/risk metrics that were highly correlated, this unified approach
balances stability (preferring consistent employment) with opportunity (rewarding
access to better contracts) in a single interpretable 0-1 scale.
